<h1>DX_FormatOnSave</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Visual Studio allows you to specify different code formatting rules for different languages it understands, but in many cases the formatting only applies to new code you're writing. For example, C# lines generally get formatted when you hit the end of the line and type the semicolon... but the only line that gets formatted is the one you just completed.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be nice if the whole document would adhere to the same formatting without you having to pay attention to it?</p>

<p>With this plugin, you can automatically have Visual Studio apply code formatting to the entire document you're working on when you save. That way you don't have to think about it - your documents will always be formatted.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>This product requires <strong>DXCore for Visual Studio .NET 11.2 or later.</strong></p>

<p>DXCore is a free download from Developer Express, Inc.: <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/DXCore/" target="_blank">http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/DXCore/</a></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>There are two ways to install - Visual Studio Extension Manager or Manual Installation.</p>

<h3>Visual Studio Extension Manager</h3>
<p>In Visual Studio, go to <code>Tools -&gt; Extension Manager</code> and search for <code>DX_FormatOnSave</code>. Click the handy button to install.</p>

<h3>Manual Installation</h3>

<ol>
<li>Exit Visual Studio to ensure no files are locked.</li>
<li>Determine the location of your DXCore community plugin folder.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>This folder will most likely be a path like:</li>
		<ul>
		<li><tt>C:\Documents and Settings\YOURUSERNAME\My Documents\DevExpress\IDE Tools\Community\PlugIns</tt> <strong>OR</strong> </li>
		<li><tt>C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\DevExpress\IDE Tools\Community\PlugIns</tt></li>
		</ul>
	<li>Your community plugin folder <strong>may have been reconfigured to be elsewhere</strong>. </li>
	<li>Its current location can be determined from the Core\Settings <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/coderushdocs/screens/options" rel="nofollow">options page</a>.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Put the DX_FormatOnSave.dll in your community plugins folder.</li>
<li>Right-click the plugin DLL, select &quot;Properties,&quot; and on the &quot;General&quot; tab, click the &quot;Unblock&quot; button. This is required to enable DXCore to properly execute the code in the plugin. </li>
<li>Restart Visual Studio.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>While usage is transparent - documents automatically get formatted when you save them - you can configure which documents the formatting will get applied to.</p>

<p>From the DevExpress menu, select "Options." In the tree on the left, go to "Editor/Code Style" and select the "Format On Save" options window. There you will be able to select which document types get formatted. </p>
