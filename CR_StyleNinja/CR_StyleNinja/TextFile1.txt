RP  = RefactoringProvider
CP  = CodeProvider
CIP = CodeIssueProvider
AST = Abstract Syntax Tree

-------------------------------------------------------------
Refactoring Logic
Availability
 - RP.CheckAvailability is passed a CheckContentAvailabilityEventArgs(ea)
 - ea.CodeActive is examined and assumed to be the element at which the caret is poistioned.
 - Routine uses ea.CodeActive to determine if RP should be available and sets ea.Available accordingly

Execute
 - RP.Execute is passed an ApplyContentEventArgs(ea)
 - ea.CodeActive is used as a reference point
 - RP.Execute performs operations against the AST and emits / replaces code in one or more Textdocuments.
-------------------------------------------------------------
CodeIssueProvider Logic
 - Code is altered
 - CIP.CheckCodeIssues is fired and passed a CheckCodeIssuesEventArgs(ea)
 - CIP.CheckCodeIssues uses ea.Scope as the scope in which to search for something to mark as an Issue
 - ea.Addhint is used to mark SourceRanges witha message. This comprises the Issue

 - A RP can be linked to an issue.
 - This is done by adding the same message to RP.SolvedIssues as used for an Issue's ea.AddHint methodcall.
 - Once linked, the RP is suggested as a potential fix for the Issue

 - However in order to be available, the RP.CheckAvailability must determine ea.Available to be true.

Questions

I can see how the CheckContentAvailabilityEventArgs is filled when a caret is moved around the screen via mouse clicks or cursor keys.
Hwo is it filled when 
How is the CheckContentAvailabilityEventArgs filled when it is an Issue that trips it rather than a mouse clicking around a document


I have had success by...
...Creating a "function Test(Element as LanguageElement) as Boolean" 
.......This Tester, Tests a LanguageElement against an Issue.
...Assigning ea.Available = Tester(ea.CodeActive) inside CheckAvailability
...Adding Hints to the ranges of any elements in EA.Scope which pass the Tester.

When the issue indicates a range,
