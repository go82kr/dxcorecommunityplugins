Purpose:
To wrap each property in a region named after it.

Method:
Use "CodeRush.Source.IterateNodesInRange" to iterate all nodes in the range of the active file. each time a node is found, check to see if it's a property  and call 'WrapElementInRegion' if it is.

'WrapElementInRegion' has 3 steps 
1. Get the text of the Element passed.
2. Add region text to the beginning and end of this text
3. Replace the original text of the element with the new version (complete with region)

Note:
We use 'QueueReplace' which adds all the replace operations to a single queue of operations. These operations are not applied until we have iterated all nodes and are back in the original 'actRegionWrapProperties_Execute' event. At this point 'CodeRush.Documents.ActiveTextDocument.ApplyQueuedEdits' naturally applies the edits.
