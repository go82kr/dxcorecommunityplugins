=== Introduction ===

If you know about [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingRockScroll.aspx RockScroll], this is for you, implemented as [http://www.devexpress.com/Downloads/NET/IDETools/DXCore/ DxCore] Plugin.

=== Installation ===

Please follow the general [InstallInstructions] on putting the plugin assembly in the right spot. With the newest !DxCore version you will be asked for a folder to place in community plugins, then this is the place to drop the !MiniCodeColumn.dll from the 
[http://code.google.com/p/dxcorecommunityplugins/wiki/DownloadInstructions?tm=2 download-list].

=== Usage ===

You can toggle the preview column on/off with a button from the DXCore visual tool bar.
A *double click* to select a word will *highlight* all occurrences
in the whole file and highlight it with a red color in the mini code column.

You can also *click* on the mini code column to *jump* to any code line.
Colapsed regions will be fully painted (non collapsed)
and splitting the texteditor is still possible (which was not possible with !RockScrollV1).
If code lines would exeed the available space, lines are compressed (2x, 3x etc.) and become _thicker_.

=== Options ===

The options page finally arrived. The [wiki:MiniCodeColumn/OptionScreenShot screenshot] was too big for this page.

=== Credits ===

Originally I found [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingRockScroll.aspx RockScroll] on a !BlogPost from Scott Hanselman, who credited this piece of software to Rocky Downs.

I am R.Warnat and I created this plugin on top of their ideas. 

With some combinations of vista and/or service packs !RockScroll 
stopped working on my machine and _I reinvented the wheel_. 

Thanks to Rory Becker this project came still quick to life.

So this got again my favorite sticker :
