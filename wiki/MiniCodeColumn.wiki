=== Introduction ===

If you know about [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingRockScroll.aspx RockScroll], this is for you, implemented as [http://www.devexpress.com/Downloads/NET/IDETools/DXCore/ DxCore] Plugin.

=== Installation ===

Please follow the general [InstallInstructions] on putting the plugin assembly in the right spot. With the newest !DxCore version you will be asked for a folder to place in community plugins, then this is the place to drop the [http://dxpluginminicodecol.googlecode.com/files/MiniCodeColumn.dll MiniCodeColumn.dll].

=== Usage ===

You can toggle the preview column on/off with a button from the DXCore visual tool bar.
A *double click* to select a word will *highlight* all occurrences
in the whole file and highlight it with a red color in the mini code column.

You can also *click* on the mini code column to *jump* to any code line.
Colapsed regions will be fully painted (non collapsed)
and splitting the texteditor is still possible (which was not possible with !RockScrollV1).
If code lines would exeed the available space, lines are compressed (2x, 3x etc.) and become _thicker_.

=== Options ===

In this early stage of coding the options page is still missing.

=== Credits ===

Originally I found [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingRockScroll.aspx RockScroll] on a !BlogPost from Scott Hanselman, who credited this piece of software to Rocky Downs.

I am R.Warnat and I created this plugin on top of their ideas. With some combinations of vista and/or service packs !RockScroll stopped working on my machine and I reinvented _the wheel_. 

So this got again my favorite sticker
