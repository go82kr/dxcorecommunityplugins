#summary Code preview column - Plugin for DxCore


= Introduction =

If you know about [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingRockScroll.aspx RockScroll], this is for you, implemented as [http://www.devexpress.com/Downloads/NET/IDETools/DXCore/ DxCore] Plugin.

= Installation =

Please follow the general [InstallInstructions] on putting the plugin assembly in the right spot. With the newest DxCore version you will be asked for a folder to place in community plugins, then this is the place to drop the [http://dxpluginminicodecol.googlecode.com/files/MiniCodeColumn.dll MiniCodeColumn.dll].

= Usage =

You can toggle the preview column on/off with a button from the DXCore visual tool bar.
A double click to select a code word will highlight the word in the whole file and highlight the word in the code preview column.

Originally I found [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingRockScroll.aspx RockScroll] on a BlogPost from Scott Hanselman, who credited this piece of software to Rocky Downs.

=== Updates ===
in a little while I will transfer code from [http://code.google.com/p/dxpluginminicodecol/ my own project] over here for easier access to the community.
