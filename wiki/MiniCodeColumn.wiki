===== Requires DXCore 10.2 since build 1566 =====
=== Introduction ===

If you know about [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingRockScroll.aspx RockScroll], this is for you, implemented as [http://www.devexpress.com/Downloads/NET/IDETools/DXCore/ DxCore] Plugin.

=== Usage ===

Open the tool-window with the menu !DevExpress -> Tool Windows -> !MiniCodeColumn.
A *double click* to select a word will *highlight* all occurrences
in the whole file and highlight it with a red color in the mini code column.

You can also *click* on the mini code column to *jump* to any code line.
Colapsed regions will be fully painted (non collapsed)
and splitting the texteditor is still possible (which was not possible with !RockScrollV1).
If code lines would exeed the available space, lines are compressed (2x, 3x etc.) and become _thicker_.
 
In this new version you can use this tool window like the scrollbar:
Click and drag inside the tool window and the code window will follow.

=== Options ===

=== Credits ===

Originally I found [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingRockScroll.aspx RockScroll] on a !BlogPost from Scott Hanselman, who credited this piece of software to Rocky Downs.

I am R.Warnat and I created this plugin on top of their ideas. 

With some combinations of vista and/or service packs !RockScroll 
stopped working on my machine and _I reinvented the wheel_. 

Thanks to Rory Becker this project came still quick to life.

So this got again my favorite sticker :

I recently set up a [http://code-seeker.blogspot.com/2009/05/minicodecolumn.html personal blog]. See you there :-)

=== Small Update ===

The flickering and slowing down of the studio is fixed as well as 
handling the highliting of more than one doubleclicked word.
