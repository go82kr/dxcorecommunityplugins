You can toggle the preview column on/off with a button from the DXCore visual tool bar.
A double click to select a code word will highlight the word in the whole file and highlight the word in the code preview column.

in a little while I will transfer code from [http://code.google.com/p/dxpluginminicodecol/ my own project] over here for easier access to the community.
