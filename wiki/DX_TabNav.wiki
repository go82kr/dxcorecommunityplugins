===== Requires DXCore 10.1 since build 1492 =====
= Introduction =
Allows VB.Net users to tab between the start and end of blocks. 

Supported blocks include Namespaces, Classes, Interfaces, Methods, Properties, Ifs, do..Whiles and others.

Support is explicitly enabled for only VB.Net as this functionality is provided naively by visual studio for C# and other brace-based languages via the Ctrl+] key combo

= Configuration = 
Make sure that you [http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/rorybecker/archive/2010/10/05/binding-keys-in-coderush.aspx bind the {tab} key] to the "!TabNav" command.


= Usage =
Place your caret on the first character of either the first or last line of your Block and press {Tab}
