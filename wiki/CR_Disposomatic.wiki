===== Requires DXCore 11.1 =====
=== Introduction ===
Provides: 
  * 2 !CodeIssues 
    * Class should Implement IDisposable
    * Fields should be Disposed
  * 2 !CodeProviders 
    * Implement IDisposable
    * Dispose Fields.

=== Usage ===

==== Scenario 1 ==== 
A class which *does not* implement IDisposable, but which has fields of types which do.

The _Class should Implement IDisposable_ !CodeIssue highlights the class and provides the _Implement IDisposable_ !CodeProvider as a fix.

The _Implement IDisposable_ !CodeProvider implements IDisposable interface and disposes of all disposable fields appropriately in the newly created Dispose method.

==== Scenario 2 ==== 
A class which *does* implement IDisposable, but which has some Disposable fields which are *Not* disposed

The _Fields Should be Disposed_ !CodeIssue highlights undisposed disposable fields in any class which does implement IDisposable. 

The _Dispose Fields_ !CodeProvider adds code to the Dispose method of the class which Disposes any undisposed fields
