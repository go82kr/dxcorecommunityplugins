===== Requires DXCore 10.2 =====
=== Introduction ===
This Refactoring / CodeProvider combination provide the user with the ability to convert an Object Initializer into a constructor call

The refactoring will perform the following conversion:

ie from...

    var myBox = new Box() {Height = 22, Width = 44, Depth = 88}

..into..

    var myBox = new Box(22, 44, 88)

The !CodeProvider will additionally create the required constructor

=== Usage ===

Place your caret on any part of the right hand expression...

    new Box() {Height = 22, Width = 44, Depth = 88}

...and select either "*Create (and convert initializer to) Constructor Call*" or "*Convert Initializer to Constructor Call*" as appropriate
