===== Build using !CodeRush 11.1 =====
=== Introduction ===
This plugin allows you to use the existing !TabToNextReference functionality to navigate between the an open and close pair of tags.

=== Additional Configuration ===
In addition to downloading and installing the plugin dll, you will need to adjust the context of the *Tab* and *Shift+Tab* shortcuts in order to make this work.

Here are the steps needed to achieve this:

  * !DevExpress\Options (Or Ctrl+Shift+Alt+O)
  * IDE\Shortcuts
  * Navigation\References\NavFields
  * Highlight the *Tab* shortcut
  * Locate the *Editor\Code\!InPairedHtmlElementNameTag*
  * Ensure that this context is ticked.
  * Repeat previous steps for the *Shift+Tab* shortcut


=== Usage ===
Place your caret on either the open or close tag of some HTML or XML and then hit Tab. Your caret will jump to the opposing tag ready for whatever additional work you wish to engage in. This can be particularly useful when navigating around large XML documents.
