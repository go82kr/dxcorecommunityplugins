===== Requires DXCore 10.2 =====
=== Introduction ===
Plugin to convert spaces into shift keys during the creation of identifiers.

=== Configuration === 
Aside from [http://code.google.com/p/dxcorecommunityplugins/wiki/InstallInstructions the usual installation] you'll also need to do some minimal configuration to get this plugin to function.

Use the [http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/rorybecker/archive/2010/10/05/binding-keys-in-coderush.aspx shortcuts options page] to locate the !TemplateExpand binding (*Code\Expansion\[[Space]]* by default) and add a requirement that *System\ConvertingSpacesToCamelCase* is false.

=== Usage ===

With the caret in a !TextField, type it's name using spaces instead of shift keys. Any characters following the space will be converted into uppercase.

Thus typing *my[[space]]variable[[space]]name* will result in *MyVariableName*
