===== Requires DXCore 10.1 since build 1195 =====
= Introduction =

This plugin assists developers by scanning all files in a project or solution for code issues. The code issues are listed in a grid within a tool window. The grid allows grouping, filtering and sorting of code issues by type, message, solution, project and file name.

Files can be included or excluded from analysis based on their file name or content using regular expressions in the options.

*Double click a code issue to jump to it in code.*

= Usage =

Press the solution or project button to begin analysis. This may take some time dependant on the size of your project. Once analyzed a list of code issues will be shown. Analysis can be cancelled at any time.

= Installation =

Install by copying the CodeIssueAnalysis.dll to your dxcore plugins directory.

= CodeRush Xpress Users/Keyboard Shortcut =

Code Rush Xpress does not have the DevExpress menu to access the tool window. To work around this you can assign a keyboard shortcut to launch it. Follow the guide [http://rorybecker.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-bind-key-in-coderush.html here] on how to do this, the command is OpenCodeIssueAnalysis.

= Options =

Files are included and excluded from analysis by regular expressions either on their file name or content.

By default the analysis includes .cs and .vb files and excludes .designer.cs and .designer.vb files.

These options can be modified on the options page at:

*Editor -> Code Analysis -> Code Issues Analysis*<br>
