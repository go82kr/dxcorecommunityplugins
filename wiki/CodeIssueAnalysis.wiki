#Summarises all code issues in a project or solution.

= Introduction =

This plugin assists developers by scanning all files in a project or solution for code issues. The code issues are listed in a grid within a tool window. The grid allows grouping, filtering and sorting of code issues by type, message, solution, project and file name.

Files can be included or excluded from analysis based on their file name or content using regular expressions in the options.

*Double click a code issue to jump to it in code.*
