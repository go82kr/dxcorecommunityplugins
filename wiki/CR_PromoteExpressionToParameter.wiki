===== Requires DXCore 10.2 since build =====
=== Introduction ===
This plugin provides a new "Promote (Expression) To Parameter" Refactoring

It produces the same effect as using "Introduce Local" followed by "Promote to Parameter"

So all it really does is save you a a few keystrokes/ mouse movements. but that's ok, since making you more efficient is what CodeRush and the DXCore are all about.

=== Usage ===
Position your caret anywhere which allows a "Introduce Local" and you should see the additional option of "Declare Parameter" in the code section of the !CodeRush !SmartTagMenu

=== Caveats === 
See [CR_DeclareParameter]

=== Credits ===
