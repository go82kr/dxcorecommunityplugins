===== Built using DXCore 11.1  =====
=== Introduction ===
This plugin allows you to highlight a block of code you intend to change and copy it into a comment directly above the starting point.
the idea is to be able to refer to the original copy whilst editing a new version.

== Additional Configuration ==

[http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/rorybecker/archive/2010/10/05/binding-keys-in-coderush.aspx Bind the CautiousChange command] to a key or your choosing.
@!SurlyDev chose *Ctrl+'*, because it was similar to VB's natural comment key of *'*

=== Usage ===

Simply highlight your code and invoke the !CautiousChange action using whichever key you bound to it.

== Bonus Usage ==
If you invoke the !CautiousChange Command when the caret is resident on the "End amendment" of a previous '!CautiousChange', this action will remove the generated comment, leaving only your new code.

== Future Directions ==
 * Transition to a !CodeProvider
 * Tab to Next !CautiousChange
 * !CodeIssue - "!CautiousChange is incomplete"
