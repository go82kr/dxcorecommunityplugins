#summary Enables auto-complete and easy delete of single and double quotes.
= Introduction =

This plugin brings auto complete of quotes to CodeRush. Features are based on auto complete of parens and brackets, which are supported out of the box:
  * Auto complete of single and double quotes
  * Support for text fields
  * Easy delete of empty single and double quotes
  * Ignoring of closing single and double quotes while typing

Features were implemented in language agnostic way. However, plugin was tested only in c# environment. If you find any troubles using it, post issue and I try to fix it ASAP.

There is some additional logic in "auto complete" feature:
  * single quote is not completed inside comments or in compiler directive. This is for better support of natural languages, which can use apostrophes.
  * single and double quotes are not completed if are escaped with \. This is to ease entering quotes as part of string.

= Installation =

Installation instructions can be found on the InstallInstructions page.

= Usage =

= Options =

= Future work =

  * Better support for verbatim strings
  * Integration with CodeRush Feature UI

= Known Issues =

There is problem (very minor, but still) with clearing text fields from local cache. 
This will be fixed after DevExpress implement http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/Q218515.aspx?searchtext=&p=T4|P6|0 suggestion.
