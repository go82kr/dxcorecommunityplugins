= Introduction =

In 99 cases out of 100, when I open the !CodeRush options page, I want to edit either *Shortcuts* or *Templates*. 

[http://dxcorecommunityplugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/DX_DirectOptions/Screenshots/DX_DirectOptions.png] 

So I built a plugin which provides direct access to those options pages.

= Details =

The plugin provides 2 new actions "*!ShowTemplateOptions*" and "*!ShowShortcutOptions*" which you can [http://rorybecker.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-bind-key-in-coderush.html bind to any key]

Additionally these commands are made available from the !DevExpress menu as "*Template Options*" and "*Shortcut Options*" respectively.

NOTE: The "!ShowTemplateOptions" and "Template Options" are only available if you have the full !CodeRush installed or are currently running a trial of same.

= History = 
 * Build 945 
   * Altered menu items to include '...' rather than 'options'
   * Added accelerator keys (S and T respectively) to menu items
 * Build 930 
   * Initial Build
