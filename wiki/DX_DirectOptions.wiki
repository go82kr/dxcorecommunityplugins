= Introduction =

In 99 cases out of 100, when I open the !CodeRush options page, I want to edit either shortcuts or templates.

So I built a plugin which provides direct access to those options pages.

= Details =

The plugin provides 2 new actions "!ShowTemplateOptions" and "!ShowShortcutOptions" which you can [http://rorybecker.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-bind-key-in-coderush.html bind to any key]

Additionally these commands are made available from the !DevExpress menu as "Template Options" and "Shortcut Options" respectively.

NOTE: The "!ShowTemplateOptions" and "Template Options" are only available if you have the full !CodeRush installed or are currently running a trial of same.
