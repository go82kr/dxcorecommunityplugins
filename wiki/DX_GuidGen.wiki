= Introduction =

Does exactly what it says on the tin.. Generates a guid.

= Configuration =
So anywhere you can use string providers, (Templates, Selection Embedding / Inversion etc) just use the phrase "«?GenerateGuid»" without quotes and this will cause a new Guid to be generated in that location.

For example..
 * Create a new template (in the neutral language category for best effect).
 * Name this template "NewGuid" (without quotes) 
 * Set content of Template to "«?GenerateGuid»" (without quotes) 
 * Click Ok to save everything

Now you can type "NewGuid" (without quotes and case insensitive by default) and produce a new guid anywhere in the text editor :D
