#summary Author page for Casey Kramer

== Who am I == 
My name is Casey Kramer. I am a .Net developer, agile enthusiast, and CodeRush fan since 2007.  Currently my list of plugins seems to be rather skewed towards working TDD, not sure if this will change or not :) 


== Plugins ==
Here are some links to some of the plugins I have written:
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td valign="Top">
 * [CR_MoveFile]
 * [CR_CreateTestMethod]
 * [CR_NavigateToTest]
 * [CR_ShouldBeDisposable]
 * [CR_CCConsole]
</td></tr>
</table>

[CR_CreateTestMethod] contains a slew of other bits related to TDD, which should probably be extracted into separate plug-ins to make things easier

It's worth noting that [CR_CCConsole] has not been touched for about a year now, since I'm not using CruiseControl.Net on a daily basis any longer.  I recall that it was working fairly well at one point though :)
