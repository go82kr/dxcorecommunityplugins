=== Introduction ===
Some times VS gets it's knickers in a twist and all manner of things fowl up.

Sometimes a restart of studio is needed, but occasionally reloading the current solution to let VS reparse everything is quite sufficient.

However I'm lazy. I don't like having to say *File\Close Solution* followed by *File\Recent Projects and Solutions\My Solution*

This plugin a new item on the File menu which causes VS to unload and then reload the current solution.

This functionality is also bound to an Action called '!ReloadSolution' so you can bind it to a key in the !CodeRush options :)

=== Future Features ===

 - Add Accelerator key to menu item.
 - Move item to bottom of File menu 


Not much to add really.
