#summary Enables auto-complete and easy delete of generics operators <> (c# only).

= Disclaimer =

This plugin works only for c#.

= Description =

This plugin brings auto complete of generics operators in c# to CodeRush. Features are based on auto complete of parens and brackets, which are supported out of the box:
  * Auto complete of single and double quotes
  * Support for text fields
  * Adding spaces inside <>
  * Easy delete of empty single and double quotes
  * Ignoring of closing single and double quotes while typing


I did my best to detect whether < was typed as part of generics or as "lower than" operator.

If you find any troubles using it, post issue and I try to fix it ASAP.

= Installation =

Installation instructions can be found on the InstallInstructions page.

= Options =

SmartGenerics is fully configurable. Options page can be found in "Editor/Auto Complete/Generics" section of DevExpress options window.

= Future work =

  * Support for other languages.
  * Integration with CodeRush Feature UI

= Known Issues =

There is problem (very minor, but still) with clearing text fields from local cache. 
This will be fixed after DevExpress implement http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/Q218515.aspx?searchtext=&p=T4|P6|0 suggestion
