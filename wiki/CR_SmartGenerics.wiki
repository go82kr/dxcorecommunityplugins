= Disclaimer =

This plugin works only for c#.

= Introduction =

This plugin brings auto complete of generics operators in c# to CodeRush. Features are based on auto complete of parens and brackets, which are supported out of the box:
  * Auto complete of <> when < was inserted as part of generics
  * Support for text fields
  * Adding spaces inside < and > (< | >)
  * Easy delete of empty <>
  * Ignoring of closing > while typing
  * Integrated with CodeRush Feature UI

I did my best to detect whether < was typed as part of generics or as "lower than" operator. Please let me know when both cases are confused resulting in redundant or lacking >.

If you find any troubles using it, post issue and I try to fix it ASAP.

= Usage =
