=== Introduction ===
Reverses the logical meaning of a boolean variable without changing program behavior.

http://dxcorecommunityplugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/CR_ReverseBoolean/Screenshots/CR_ReverseBoolean.png

This is useful if you want to rename a Boolean variable to it's opposite intended meaning.( eg 'missing' -> 'found')

This refactoring reverses all assignments and references and removes any resulting double negations.

=== Usage ===
Place your caret on a variable whose type is bool/Boolean and invoke "Reverse Boolean" via the refactor menu.
