===== Build using DXCore 11.1 =====
=== Introduction ===
This plugin implements the NotifyPropertyChanged interface pattern for properties.

     * It can convert auto-implemented or normal properties to include a call to fire the PropertyChanged event.
     * It will implement the INPC interface if it is not already implemented on the containing type.

This plugin contains two CodeProviders:

     * The first will simply fire the INPC.PropertyChanged event directly in the property set block after expansion.
     * The second assumes you have base class support for firing PropertyChanged through an OnPropertyChanged method that takes a lambda expression. 

For the base class support, you can use the Prism 4 NotificationObject base class: http://prism.codeplex.com.
