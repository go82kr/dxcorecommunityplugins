===== Build using DXCore 11.1 =====
=== Introduction ===
This code expansion plugin allows you to expand or convert a property declaration so that it also fires the PropertyChanged event of the !INotifyPropertyChanged interface.

     * It can convert auto-implemented or normal properties to include a call to fire the !PropertyChanged event.
     * It will implement the INPC interface if it is not already implemented on the containing type.

This plugin contains two !CodeProviders:

     * The first will simply fire the INPC.!PropertyChanged event directly in the property set block after expansion.
     * The second assumes you have base class support for firing !PropertyChanged through an !OnPropertyChanged method that takes a lambda expression. 

For the lambda expression base class support, you can use the Prism 4 !NotificationObject base class: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.practices.prism.viewmodel.notificationobject(v=pandp.39).aspx.
