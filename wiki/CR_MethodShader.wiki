#summary Alters the background color of members to indicate status according to a nominated Metric.

=== Introduction ===

This plugin changes the bckground color of your classes members to indicate how well they adhere to a nominated metric.

So good methods remain white. and the colors escalate Green, Orange, Red as the Metric value goes up.

Each metric has a numeric value which is said to be the Warning value.
 * 0-25% = White.
 * 25-50% = Green.
 * 50-75% = Orange.
 * 75%+ = Red.

In the screenshot above I am using a Demo Metric which counts the number of lines in te member and has the Warning value set to 15. this is a useless metric created (within this plugin) purely for the purposes of being able to create this screenshot.

The options screen allows you to pick from any Member Metric within Coderush and displays it's Warning value alongside the dropdown.
