#summary Templates that Generate Multiple Files

= Introduction =

Create a multi-file Winform without going near the file new dialog
= Details =

Proof of concept....

  * Install Plug-in and import VB templates [http://www.rorybecker.me.uk/DevExpress/Plugins/Community/CR_MultiFileTemplates/ found here]
  * Create VB Console App
  * Type {{{cnf<space> }}}
  * Witness the creation of a new Form without visiting the File new Dialog
  * Repeat
  * Notice Form2 used instead of Form1

C# templates can be created just as easily. I may even upload some later.
