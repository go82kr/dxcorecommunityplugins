===== Built using DXCore 11.1 since build =====
=== Introduction ===
This plugin provides an additional menu item on the Navigate menu.

It allows the user to jump from a variable reference, to the variable's type's declaration.

=== Usage ===
Simply place you caret on a reference to a variable and press Ctrl+Alt+N (Navigate Shortcut)

One of the options should be to navigate to the "Type Declaration". If this is selected then a marker will be dropped and CodeRush will navigate to the declaration of that variable's type.

=== Optional Configuration ===

You can also configure a shortcut to directly trigger this navigation. 

Shortcuts may be configured via the [http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/rorybecker/archive/2010/10/05/binding-keys-in-coderush.aspx DevExpress\Options ... IDE\Shortcuts] page.

In this case you bind to the 'Navigate' command passing 'Type Declaration' as a parameter.

You should also configure the shortcut to only work whilst the code editor has focus. This is done through the contextpicker. Locate the *Focus\Documents\Source\Code Editor* context and place a checkmark next to it. This will only allow this shortcut to operate when this context evaluates to true.
