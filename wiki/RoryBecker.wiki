#summary Author page for Rory Becker :)

== Who am I == 
My name is Rory Becker. I am the original founder of this site and I am responsible, for better or worse, for several (but most definitely *not* all) of the plugins on this site. 


== Plugins ==
Here are some links to some of the plugins I have written or contributed to:
