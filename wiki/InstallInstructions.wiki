=== Install ===
*Note: These instructions assume that you have already installed the* [Prerequisites] *and that your DXCore version is 9.3.4 or higher.*


 # Download the latest zip containing the plugin that you wish to install. Each plugin's wiki page has a download link that takes you to a folder containing...
   * The latest version of the plugin.
   * An archive folder with previous versions of the plugin.
 # Exit Visual Studio to ensure no files are locked.
 # Determine the location of your DXCore community plugin folder.
    * In versions before DXCore 9.1, this is typically something like: `C:\Program Files\Developer Express Inc\DXCore for Visual Studio .NET\2.0\Bin\Plugins`
    * In 9.1 and later, it's like:
      * `C:\Documents and Settings\YOURUSERNAME\My Documents\DevExpress\IDE Tools\Community\PlugIns` *OR*
      * `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\DevExpress\IDE Tools\Community\PlugIns` *OR*
      * `C:\Program Files\DevExpress 2009.1\IDETools\Community\PlugIns` 
   * Your community plugin folder *may have been reconfigured to be elsewhere*.
   * Its current location can be determined from the Core\Settings [http://sites.google.com/site/coderushdocs/screens/options options page].  
 # Extract the plugin DLL from the zip file you downloaded and save it in your community plugins folder.
 # Right-click the plugin DLL, select "Properties," and on the "General" tab, click the "Unblock" button. This is required to enable DXCore to properly execute the code in the plugin.
 # Restart Visual Studio. The new plugin should be available.
