#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

==== Prerequisites ====
Plugins on this site all require:
 * A non-express version of either VS2005 or VS2008
 * A [http://devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/DXCore/ DXCore] based product (DXCore, [http://devexpress.com/coderush CodeRush], [http://devexpress.com/crx CodeRush Xpress] or [http://devexpress.com/refactor RefactorPro])
   * The required version of these products varies. We generally recommend trying to stay as current as possible

=== Install ===
*Note: These instructions assume that the above products are already installed on your machine, and that your DXCore version is 9.3.4 or higher.*


 # Download the latest zip of the plugin that you wish to install.
   * Download links, on each plugin's wikipage are to a folder containing the latest Zip file and an archive folder which contains previous version.
 # Determine the location of your community plugin folder
   * Your community plugin folder defaults to `My docs\DevExpress\IDE Tools\Community\PlugIns`
   * Your community plugin folder may have been reconfigured to be elsewhere. 
   * It's current location can be determined from the Core\Settings [http://sites.google.com/site/coderushdocs/screens/options options page].  
 # If updating a plugin already installed, please exit Visual Studio to ensure no files are locked.
 # Extract the plugin dll from the Zip file into your community plugins folder
 # Restart Visual Studio.

=== Usage ===
Each plugin has its own usage instructions. See the [http://code.google.com/p/dxcorecommunityplugins/w/list wiki] for more on each individual plugin.
