= Introduction =
Provides !StyleCop style hints through the !CodeRush !CodeIssues interface without the need to install !StyleCop. 
These hints/rules will work across languages using user preferences (as stored in !CodeRush's style settings) rather that actual !StyleCop rules, where applicable.

= Usage =
These rules will work as long as the !CodeIssues function is turned on. 

Note: The !CodeIssues feature is NOT available in !CodeRush Xpress. However another community plugin ([CodeIssueAnalysis]) does provide access to these issues.

= Options =
This plugin does not provide it's own options screen at the moment. It will however use the preferences set up in !CodeRush's "Editor\Code Style\Identifiers"  options page.

= Rules = 

The following rules are implemented at this time:

 * Fields start with {{{<YourPreferenceHere>}}}
 * Locals start with {{{<YourPreferenceHere>}}}
 * Params start with {{{<YourPreferenceHere>}}}
 * Interfaces start with 'I'
 * Elements start with uppercase char: 
   * Namespaces
   * Classes
   * Structs
   * Enums
   * Methods
   * Properties
   * Delegates
   * Events
