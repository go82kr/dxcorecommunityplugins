=== Introduction ===

NB: I have recently been looking back through some shared Google docs and have found evidence suggesting the original idea for this plugin was that of Dan Gilkerson (<- Great Bloke) 

This plugin changes the background color of your class's members to indicate how well they adhere to a nominated metric.

So members that stack up well remain white, and the colors escalate Green, Orange, Red as the Metric value goes up.

Each metric has a numeric value which is said to be the Warning Value.
 * 0-25% = White.
 * 25-50% = Green.
 * 50-75% = Orange.
 * 75%+ = Red.

In the screenshot above I am using a Demo Metric which counts the number of lines in the member and has the Warning Value set to 15. This is a useless metric created (within this plugin) purely for the purposes of being able to create this screenshot.

=== Options === 
The options screen allows you to pick from any Metric (that does its calcs on members) within CodeRush and displays it's Warning value alongside the dropdown.

Additionally you can change any of the colors, opacities of those colors or the boundaries by which the logic works.

You can also enable/disable the plugin entirely.

Apparently CR_MetricShader looks good on a dark scheme also :)
