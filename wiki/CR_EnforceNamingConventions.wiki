===== Built using CodeRush 11.1 =====
=== Introduction ===
This plugin is an example of how to apply a naming convention across your solution.

The specific naming convention will perform 3 operations:
 * Remove any underscore prefixing.
 * Change non-public fields to have a lowercase first letter.
 * Change other members to have an uppercase first letter.

=== Usage ===
Simply pick the 'Enforce Naming Convention' option from the DevExpress menu.

The plugin will then iterate through your solution, adjusting the name of every member of every type in accordance with the stated naming convention.
