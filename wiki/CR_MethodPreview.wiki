= Introduction =

Provides an action 'ToggleMethodPreview' actionable from any method call whose source is available and provides that source as a preview window.

= Configuration =
 * Assign the 'ToggleMethodPreview' to a key. (see [http://rorybecker.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-bind-key-in-coderush.html Binding a Key])

= Usage =

 * Place caret on any Method Call for which the source is available within the solution.
 * Activate the 'ToggleMethodPreview' action using whichever key you bound to it.

 * Deactivate when done, using the same key.

= Notes =

This plugin currently shows the entire method.
The plan is to limit this to the first n (defaulting to say 30) lines. However the DXCore currently needs the entire method in order to format things correctly.
