This plug-in provides various ways to better interact with the results of the CodeRush Unit Test Runner.

= Introduction =

The new Unit Test Runner in CodeRush 9.3.2 is nice. But I felt the built in on-screen pass/fail information was too sublte or lacking. I wanted more insight on the test results; in particular those that failed. This plug-in provides a few ways to get more information about the results of a test run.

= Details =

So far there are three optional visualizations that are applied to the CodeRush Unit Test Runner Results.
http://dxcorecommunityplugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/UnitTestErrorVisualizer/Screenshots/UnitTestVisualizer.png
  # The test attribute is shaded with red when a test faile, green when it passes, and yellow if it is skipped. No shading happens for tests that are pending or have been changed after the current result was run.
  # The message is parsed to determine why the test failed and the key reason is displayed as overlay text at the end of the line of the assert which failed.
  # An arrow is drawn from the learn more icon to the failed assert and the why it failed information is placed in a rectangle over the arrow

The first two are really just carry over ideas from the RedGreen plug-in. Any one of the visualizations can be turned on/off from an options page.

= Limitations =
At present there is CodeRush provides no way to know when the status of a unit test result has changed, only a way to get the list. So some of these features don't appear unil a refresh gives the plug-in a chance to check the current status.
