= Introduction =

CR_MsdnBclHelp is a plugin which supplies a single action called "MSDN BCL Help". 

This action, when [http://rorybecker.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-bind-key-in-coderush.html bound to a key] and triggered, will cause the plugin to launch an MSDN web page for the Type or Member located at the caret.

= Usage =

Given the source code:
----
private void SomeMethod()
{
    Console.Writeline();
}
----

 * Triggering this action whilst the caret is on 'Console' will launch http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.console.aspx
 * Triggering this action whilst the caret is on 'Writeline' will launch http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.console.writeline.aspx

= Additional Configuration =

If passed a single string as a parameter (ie device or loband), the action will integrate this parameter as a part of the url opened. This switch is an indicator to MSDN of which style of page you would like to see. See [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LowBandwidthViewAndOtherHiddenAndFutureFeaturesOfMSDN.aspx]
