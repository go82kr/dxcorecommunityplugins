==== Further Configuration ====

You want to, you could [http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/rorybecker/archive/2010/10/05/binding-keys-in-coderush.aspx bind this navigation directly to a keyboard shortcut]. 

I might suggest the F12 key, since this functionality is akin to !GotoDefinition.

==== Limitations ====
This version of the navigation can only find Razor views. ie vbhtml or cshtml files.
