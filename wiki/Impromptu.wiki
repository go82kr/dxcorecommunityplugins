= Introduction =

I used to use TestDriven.Net before it required a license purchase. I loved it's Ad Hoc test run feature. This plug-in reproduces the behavior without a right click.

= Details =

When you create a method that takes no parameters, Impromptu will place a gear icon to the left of the method signature.
