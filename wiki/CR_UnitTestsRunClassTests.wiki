===== Built using DXCore 11.2 =====
=== Introduction ===

This plugin provides 2 new actions which may be bound to keys.

These actions are *!UnitTestsRunClassTests* and *!UnitTestsDebugClassTests*.

These function similarly to the other UnitTestsXXXXX actions, in that a given set of tests are either run or debugged depending on the action invoked.

For the purpose of this plugin, !ClassTests refers to the set of Tests that are found within a class named after the original source class with a suffix of "_Tests"

Therefore, when invoked from within a class '!MyClass', the plugin will look for a class called '!MyClass_Tests' and execute any tests within that class.

The plugin will look for this class in several locations.
{{{
 - [OriginalNamespace].[SourceClass]_Tests (Original Project)
 - [OriginalNamespace].[SourceClass]_Tests (Other Projects)
 - [InitialOriginalNamespace]_Tests.[RemainingNamespace].[SourceClass]_Tests (Original Project)
 - [InitialOriginalNamespace]_Tests.[RemainingNamespace].[SourceClass]_Tests (Other Projects)
}}}
If none of these are found, the plugin will search all classes in all solutions, looking for the first one called {{{[SourceClass]_Tests}}}

The first of these, if any, to be found will have any tests found within it executed.

=== Configuration ===
Simply [http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/rorybecker/archive/2010/10/05/binding-keys-in-coderush.aspx add bindings] to *!UnitTestsRunClassTests* and *!UnitTestsDebugClassTests*

=== Usage ===

Invoke the provided actions using the bound shortcuts.
