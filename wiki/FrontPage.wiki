Important Note: The plugins on this front page are not the only ones on this site. we have more... Just [http://code.google.com/p/dxcorecommunityplugins/w/list peruse the wiki]. Most (but not all) plugin pages are prefixed DX_ or CR_ and if you're feeling really brave you can even skip past the wiki and just go [http://www.rorybecker.me.uk/DevExpress/Plugins/Community/ peruse the binary downloads] :) 


We have some [http://code.google.com/p/dxcorecommunityplugins/wiki/PluginResources info on how to get started in creating a plugin]...

...OR if you want to dive straight in, we have several existing plugins for the DXCore that add various functions to Visual Studio - from highlighting key elements on screen to refactoring help.

It's also worth noting that we are not the only source of DXCore plugins. 
There are [3rdPartyPlugins some others out there].
