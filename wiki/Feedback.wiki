#summary Ways to provide feedback on the plugins

=== Closed Comments === 

We have decided to disable the comments in the community plugin wiki, as it is felt that they require too much maintenance, and are near useless once the number of comments goes beyond the first 4 or 5 entries. 

Instead we would like to offer you some alternative means of communication with us:

==== Author Pages ====
In some cases the authors have put up pages on the wiki to let the world know a little more about themselves. These pages might serve as a place to list the plugins they have been involved in, or provide some contact information such as email address or links to their blogs or twitter account.

If such a page is available, it will usually be linked to, in the credits section of plugin wiki pages written by the relevant author.

==== DXCore Plugin Forum ==== 

Additionally we have asked, and been granted, the kind permission of Developer Express, to use their [http://community.devexpress.com/forums/181.aspx 'DXCore Plugins' forum] for any discussions pertaining to the plugins on this site.

So if you'd like to discuss bugs, existing features, suggestions for new plugins or just shoot the breeze and maybe talk about how various plugins achieve what they do... then please feel free to make yourself known in the forum, and we'll see what we can do to help you.
