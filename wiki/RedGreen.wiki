= Installation =

Two steps are needed for RedGreen to work. The first is to follow the normal DxCore Community Plug-in instructions. The second is to install Gallio, available at www.gallio.org. RedGreen uses Gallio to run the tests because it supports most of the current testing frameworks.

= Usage =

Simply hover over the tets runner Icon and select a "Run" option.
