===== Built using CodeRush 11.2.7 =====
=== Introduction ===
The existing *Create Ancestor* !CodeProvider that comes with !CodeRush does not function if the Class in question already has a code ancestor.

This plugin is to fill that void.

=== Usage ===

 * Place your *caret* (`That blinky thing where text comes out in the editor`) in a *class declaration* (on it's name is good) 
 * Trigger the CodeRush\Refactor !SmartMenu. 
 * Choose *Insert New Parent Class*

 * You're done :)
