#summary provides an action (Execute) for executing any arbitrary VS command.

= Introduction =

This plugin provides an action (Execute) for executing and arbitrary VS command.

= Motivation = 

At first glance this would seem to be pointless because it would seem that you can already bind Commands to any Keystroke. This is true 

However it had been requested previously that it would be nice to be able to bind to Mouse input. And since DXCore actions are bindable to Mouse or Keyboard I felt that this would be a good way to do it.

= Installation =

Installation instructions can be found on the InstallInstructions page.

= Usage =

1.> Bind the 'Execute' action to any Key/Mouse shortcut from within DevExpress\Options\IDE\Shortcuts

2.> Specify The name of the Command in the Parameter box.

= Example = 

Bind Ctrl+LeftClick to "Execute" with a parameter of "Edit.GoToDefinition"
