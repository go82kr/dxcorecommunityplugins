#summary provides an action (Execute) for executing any arbitrary VS command.

= Obsolete =
This plugin is largely obsolete as CR already allows one to bind Mouse and Keys to VS commands aswell as DXCore Actions.

It is less apparent but you can simply type the name of a command into the Command Dropdown on the IDE\Shortcuts options page in CodeRush and this will have the same effect as CR_Execute was designed to.

Perhaps this plugin should be re-envisioned as a way to execute a sequence of actions?

= Introduction =

This plugin provides an action (Execute) for executing and arbitrary VS command.

= Motivation = 

At first glance this would seem to be pointless because it would seem that you can already bind Commands to any Keystroke. This is true 

However it had been requested previously that it would be nice to be able to bind to Mouse input. And since DXCore actions are bindable to Mouse or Keyboard I felt that this would be a good way to do it.

= Installation =

Installation instructions can be found on the InstallInstructions page.

= Usage =

1.> Bind the 'Execute' action to any Key/Mouse shortcut from within DevExpress\Options\IDE\Shortcuts

2.> Specify The name of the Command in the Parameter box.

= Example = 

Bind Ctrl+LeftClick to "Execute" with a parameter of "Edit.GoToDefinition"
