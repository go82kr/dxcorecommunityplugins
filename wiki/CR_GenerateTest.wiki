===== Requires DXCore 10.2 since build 1576 =====
= Introduction =

Generates a new stub method, creating a class and project around it as needed.

= Details =

 * Generates a Test Project 
   * References your *SourceProject*
   * References '*Nunit.Framework.dll*'
 * Generates a Test Class 
   * Marks it with a *!TestFixture* Attribute
 * Generates an empty Test Method
   * Marks it with a *Test* Attribute

So if you have 

----
{{{
Public Class SomeClass
    Public Sub SomeMethod()
    End Sub 
End Class
}}}
----
... in a Project called "SomeProject"

Then activation will cause the generation of an additional project within the solution called "SomeProject_Tests".

This project will contain a class...
----
{{{
Imports Nunit.Framework
<TestFixture> _
Public Class SomeClass_Tests
    <Test> _
    Public Sub Test_Test()
    End Sub 
End Class
}}}
----
